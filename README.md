# Overlap Graphs for State Estimation in Dynamic Environments

This project lays out a path to comparing different modalities of robotic perception to accurately estimate the current state of a robot in a dynamic environment. To do this, we store the "agreements" of different sensing modalities in an "overlap graph" to determine which modalities are accurately perceiving the world around the robot. 

The hope of this project is that a robot using an "Overlap Graph" can dynamically respond to changes in it's environment that may degrade certain sensing modalities, such as darkness degrading visual sensors or muddy conditions dgrading wheel odometry.
